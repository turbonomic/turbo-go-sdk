// The TemplateDTO message represents entity types (templates) that the probe expects to
// discover in the target. For the probe to load in Operations Manager, it must discover
// entity types that are valid members of the supply chain, and these entities must have
// valid buy/sell relationships. Specifying the set of templates for a probe serves to
// validate that the specific entities the probe discovers and sends to Operations Manager do
// indeed match the entity descriptions the probe is expected to discover.
//
// Specify entity type by setting an EntityType value to the templateClass field.
//
// An entity can maintain a list of commodities that it sells.
//
// An entity can maintain a map of commodities bought (TemplateCommodity objects). Each map key is
// an instance of Provider. For each provider, the map entry is a list of the commodities bought
// from that provider.

// Extension (see TemplateType).

// of an entity, which means this probe performs the primary discovery of the entity and places it in the market.
// Note that there can be more than one probe that discovers the same Base entity. The template has a
// templatePriority setting that resolves such a collision. The template with the highest priority value
// wins, and discoveries made for the lower-priority template are ignored.
//
// An extension template adds data to already discovered entities. This is a way to extend the
// commodities managed by a base template.
